# Bayesian Statistics for Ecologists Summer School

For now this repository will serve as a way to exchange and develop the material for the course.

# Organisation of the folders

## General
This folder will include:
  - Syllabus
  - General schedule for the week
  - Class-specific schedule for the week

## Theory
This folder *has* to include:
  - .tex file for each theoretical lecture
  - A folder called *Image* where a images will be stored
  - The basic files to build the class material

This folder may (but does not have to) include:
  - .Rnw files if people want to develop their lecture using knitr
  - .Rmd files if people want to develop their lecture using Rmarkdown

*Note*: When the an .Rnw or a .Rmd file is available it should be used to construct the lecture because some aspect may not show in the final .pdf.

This folder should *not* include:
  - .pdf files used for the presentation
  - Intermediary files generated by LaTeX

## Practice
It is not yet clear what this folder will hold exactly. It will likely be a combination of
  - .R files
  - .tex files with exercices
  - .tex files with solutions
  - .RnW files with exercices
  - .Rnw files with solutions
  - .Rmd files with exercices
  - .Rmd files with solutions
