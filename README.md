# Bayesian Statistics for Ecologists Summer School

For now this repository will serve as a way to exchange and develop the material for the course.

# Organisation of the folders

## General
This folder will include:
  - Syllabus
  - General schedule for the week
  - Class-specific schedule for the week

## Theory
This folder *has* to include:
  - `.tex` file for each theoretical lecture
  - A folder called *Image* where a images will be stored
  - The basic files to build the class material

This folder may (but does not have to) include:
  - `.Rnw` files if people want to develop their lecture using [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/)
  - `.Rmd` files if people want to develop their lecture using [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)

*Note*: When an `.Rnw` or `.Rmd` file is available it should be used to construct the lecture instead of the .tex file because some aspect may not show in the final .pdf if only the .tex is used.

This folder should *not* include:
  - .pdf files used for the presentation
  - Intermediary files generated by LaTeX

## Practice
It is not yet clear what this folder will hold exactly. It will likely be a combination of
  - `.R` files
  - `.tex` files with exercices
  - `.tex` files with solutions
  - `.RnW` files with exercices
  - `.Rnw` files with solutions
  - `.Rmd` files with exercices
  - `.Rmd` files with solutions
